## PRIVILEGE ESCALATION CHALLENGES

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: PRIVESC -->

### Privilege Escalation Challenges

#### n00b_mode: "First Root Access"

```
BEGINNER CHALLENGE: First Root Access

CONCEPT: Basic Linux Privilege Escalation

SCENARIO:
You've gained access to a Linux system as a regular user, but you need administrator (root) privileges.

OBJECTIVE:
Escalate your privileges from regular user to root using a misconfigured SUID binary.

GUIDANCE:
1. Log in to the practice system with provided credentials
2. Use the find command to locate SUID binaries:
   find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
3. Look for unusual binaries in the results
4. Notice the custom binary called "backup_tool"
5. Check if it runs with root privileges using:
   ls -la /usr/local/bin/backup_tool
6. Run the binary and observe its functionality
7. Try using the binary in a way that gives you a shell:
   /usr/local/bin/backup_tool "ignored; /bin/bash"

EXPLANATION:
- SUID (Set User ID) binaries run with the permissions of the file owner
- If a SUID binary is owned by root, it runs with root privileges
- Improper input handling can allow command injection
- This lets you execute commands as root

TOOLS NEEDED:
- Terminal access to practice Linux system
- Basic Linux command knowledge

LEARNING OUTCOME:
Understanding SUID binaries and basic privilege escalation techniques in Linux.
```

#### script_kiddie_mode: "Windows Privilege Escalation"

## PASSWORD ATTACK CHALLENGES

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: PASSWORD_ATTACKS -->

### Password Attack Challenges

#### n00b_mode: "Password Cracking Basics"

```
BEGINNER CHALLENGE: Password Cracking Basics

CONCEPT: Password Cracking Fundamentals

SCENARIO:
You've obtained a password hash and need to recover the original password.

OBJECTIVE:
Crack a simple MD5 password hash using a basic dictionary attack.

GUIDANCE:
1. Open a terminal in your practice environment
2. Create a file called hash.txt with this MD5 hash:

   john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
4. Wait for John to find the password
5. Verify the recovered password is "password"

EXPLANATION:
- Password hashes are one-way transformations of passwords
- Dictionary attacks try known words from a wordlist
- Some hashing algorithms (like MD5) are fast to compute
- Fast hashing allows for rapid password guessing
- Common passwords are almost always in wordlists

1. Use hash identification tools to determine hash types
2. Select appropriate cracking tools and methods for each type
3. Configure rule-based attacks to improve success rates
4. Use multiple wordlists and attack methods
5. Document your methodology and results

HINTS:
- Hint 1: Try hash-identifier or hashid to determine hash types

## MEMORY EXPLOITATION CHALLENGES

<!-- AI.CONTEXT: MEMORY_EXPLOITATION -->

### Memory Exploitation Challenges

#### n00b_mode: "Stack Overflow Basics"

```
BEGINNER CHALLENGE: Stack Overflow Basics

CONCEPT: Buffer Overflow Fundamentals

SCENARIO:
You're learning how memory corruption vulnerabilities work, specifically buffer overflows.

OBJECTIVE:
Exploit a simple buffer overflow vulnerability to change program behavior.

GUIDANCE:
1. Download the vulnerable program "overflow1" to your practice environment
2. Run the program with a normal input: ./overflow1 AAAA
3. Notice it just echoes your input
4. Experiment with longer inputs:
   ./overflow1 $(python -c 'print("A" * 10)')
   ./overflow1 $(python -c 'print("A" * 50)')
5. Notice when the input gets long enough, you get a "Segmentation fault"
6. Try to find the exact length that causes the crash
7. Modify your input to include a specific value:
   ./overflow1 $(python -c 'print("A" * 44 + "BBBB")')
8. Check if you can control the program crash

EXPLANATION:
- Programs allocate fixed-size buffers in memory
- When input exceeds buffer size, it "overflows" into adjacent memory
- This can overwrite important memory like return addresses
- By controlling the overflow, you can change program behavior

TOOLS NEEDED:
- Linux terminal
- Python (for generating pattern)
- Vulnerable practice program (provided)

LEARNING OUTCOME:
Understanding basic buffer overflow concepts and memory corruption.

2. Determine the buffer size and offset to return address
3. Create a pattern to identify exact crash location
4. Generate a payload with the provided shellcode
5. Construct and test your exploit

HINTS:
- Hint 1: Use pattern_create.rb and pattern_offset.rb from Metasploit
- Hint 2: Check for memory protections with checksec
